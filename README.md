# Song Suggest

Song Suggest is a toy application for me to learn ReactJS and Flux. It is a
simple application that parses the Last.FM API looking for similar songs based
on a given Artist and Track name.

To see a running demo, checkout [http://dansackett.github.io/song-suggest](http://dansackett.github.io/song-suggest).
